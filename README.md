# Ramjet-Propulsion-Analysis
 Parametric Studies of RAMJET Propulsion Performance

This project involves developing a MATLAB-based analytical tool to investigate the performance characteristics of a non-ideal ramjet propulsion system. By simulating various operational conditions and thermodynamic parameters, the tool evaluates key metrics like thrust, overall efficiency, and specific fuel consumption across diverse scenarios. It incorporates parametric studies on factors such as flight altitude, Mach numbers, and component efficiencies to optimize performance for different mission profiles. The analysis not only aids in understanding the systemâ€™s dynamics but also provides insights into its real-world applicability under specific constraints like thermal limits.
